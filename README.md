# vowelcounter

Welcome to my Vowel Counter!

This program is executed in the command line. The user enters the program name and a file name of their choosing. 
The program runs through the file and check for vowel characters, both uppercase and lowercase and adds them up. It
then outputs the totals for each vowel and the total of all vowels.
